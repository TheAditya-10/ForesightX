Project goal

Build a production-ready system that ingests market & alternative data, trains and backtests a suite of time-series and ML models, 
serves predictions (point + interval) via REST, automatically retrains when needed, monitors data/model health and shows 
interactive explanations & dashboards on nwebsite.


OK so first we will make few notebooks to get full picture and then we will make whole app with deployment. 
So we have different stages in ml project that are
- Data Ingestion 
- EDA
- Pre-processing
- Feature Engg & Feature Selections
- Model Training 
- Model Eval

- Data Ingestion 

ok then we will go and create notebook cells for each step one by one 
first data ingestion  we want the latest as long possible historical data to train model of any stock. 
and then it will predict for the next day. so write a cell for data injection
